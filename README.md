# G. Adam Cox

I am an experimental physicist (Ph.D. UW 2008), with research interest in quantum information sciences (algorithms and hardware),
neutrinos (Sudbury Neutrino Observatory), and direct dark matter
detection (EDELWEISS). I also have extensive experience in industry building ML and AI tools for both scientific and business applications.

Below is a somewhat organized, though not exhaustive (due to proprietary work or forgetfulness), list of projects, courses, code, notes, etc.
